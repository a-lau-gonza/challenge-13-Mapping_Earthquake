# Challenge 13 Mapping Earthquakes
This was another funky challenge for the class which really utilizes data visualization in a more appealing form to myself. 

Earthquakes are a worldwide phenomenon that affects everyone on the planet. The daily repurcussions can lead from small annoyances to major economic and natural disasters that affect the entirety of the human race. Tracking the epicenters, magnitudes, and earthquake frequencies can help humanity in avoiding pitfalls when it comes to safety both in human lives as well as in human capital, as rebuilding hampers human progress.
